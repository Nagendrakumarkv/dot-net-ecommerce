Building a clone of Flipkart is a massive project, but breaking it down into a 15-Day MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Plan makes it manageable.

We will use ASP.NET Core MVC (to keep frontend and backend in one project for simplicity), PostgreSQL, and VS Code.

Here is your roadmap to building the "FlipKart Clone."

The 15-Day Roadmap
Phase 1: Foundation & Users (Days 1-3)
Day 1: Project Setup, Database Architecture, and basic Configuration.

Day 2: Authentication & Authorization (Login/Register using ASP.NET Identity).

Day 3: Base Layout Design (Navbar, Footer, Bootstrap setup for that "Flipkart Blue" look).

Phase 2: Product Catalog (Days 4-7)
Day 4: Admin Panel - Category Management (Electronics, Fashion, etc.).

Day 5: Admin Panel - Product Management (CRUD: Add Images, Price, Description).

Day 6: Home Page - Displaying Products & "Deal of the Day" carousel.

Day 7: Product Listing Page - Search, Filter by Price, Sort by Popularity.

Phase 3: Shopping Core (Days 8-11)
Day 8: Product Details Page (Zoom image, Specifications, Reviews section).

Day 9: Shopping Cart (Add/Remove items, Update quantity, Session management).

Day 10: User Addresses (Save multiple delivery addresses).

Day 11: Checkout Flow (Review Cart -> Select Address -> Payment Summary).

Phase 4: Orders & Payments (Days 12-13)
Day 12: Order Placement (Saving the order to DB) & reducing Stock.

Day 13: Payment Integration (Mocking a payment gateway like Razorpay/Stripe).

Phase 5: User & Admin Features (Days 14-15)
Day 14: Order History (User view) & Order Management (Admin view: Ship/Deliver).

Day 15: Polish (Error pages, Form Validations) & Final Deployment.
