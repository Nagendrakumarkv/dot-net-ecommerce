Building a clone of Flipkart is a massive project, but breaking it down into a 15-Day MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Plan makes it manageable.

We will use ASP.NET Core MVC (to keep frontend and backend in one project for simplicity), PostgreSQL, and VS Code.

Here is your roadmap to building the "FlipKart Clone."

The 15-Day Roadmap
Phase 1: Foundation & Users (Days 1-3)
Day 1: Project Setup, Database Architecture, and basic Configuration.

Day 2: Authentication & Authorization (Login/Register using ASP.NET Identity).

Day 3: Base Layout Design (Navbar, Footer, Bootstrap setup for that "Flipkart Blue" look).

Phase 2: Product Catalog (Days 4-7)
Day 4: Admin Panel - Category Management (Electronics, Fashion, etc.).

Day 5: Admin Panel - Product Management (CRUD: Add Images, Price, Description).

Day 6: Home Page - Displaying Products & "Deal of the Day" carousel.

Day 7: Product Listing Page - Search, Filter by Price, Sort by Popularity.

Phase 3: Shopping Core (Days 8-11)
Day 8: Product Details Page (Zoom image, Specifications, Reviews section).

Day 9: Shopping Cart (Add/Remove items, Update quantity, Session management).

Day 10: User Addresses (Save multiple delivery addresses).

Day 11: Checkout Flow (Review Cart -> Select Address -> Payment Summary).

Phase 4: Orders & Payments (Days 12-13)
Day 12: Order Placement (Saving the order to DB) & reducing Stock.

Day 13: Payment Integration (Mocking a payment gateway like Razorpay/Stripe).

Phase 5: User & Admin Features (Days 14-15)
Day 14: Order History (User view) & Order Management (Admin view: Ship/Deliver).

Day 15: Polish (Error pages, Form Validations) & Final Deployment.

1. Project Creation & Setup
   These commands were used on Day 1 to start the project.

Create the Solution/Project:

Bash

dotnet new mvc -n FlipkartClone
cd FlipkartClone

2. Package Installation (NuGet)
   These commands add external libraries to your project. You can run these anytime to add features.

Database (PostgreSQL) Packages:

Bash

dotnet add package Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design

Identity (Security/Login) Packages:

Bash

dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.UI
dotnet add package Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design

Alternative: Restore Packages manually (if editing .csproj):

Bash

dotnet restore

3. Database Management (Entity Framework)
These are the most frequently used commands. You run these whenever you change a Model (like adding a new table or column).

Create a Migration (Snapshot of your code changes):

Bash

dotnet ef migrations add NameOfMigration
# Examples we used:
# dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
# dotnet ef migrations add AddIdentitySchema
# dotnet ef migrations add AddAddressTable
# dotnet ef migrations add AddOrderTables

Update Database (Apply changes to PostgreSQL):

Bash

dotnet ef database update

4. Scaffolding (Code Generation)
Used on Day 2 to generate the Login/Register pages.

Install the Generator Tool (Global):

Bash

dotnet tool install -g dotnet-aspnet-codegenerator
(If it fails, try adding --version 8.0.0)

Generate Identity Pages:

Bash

dotnet aspnet-codegenerator identity -dc FlipkartClone.Data.ApplicationDbContext

5. Running & Debugging
Used every day to see your work.

Run the App (Developer Mode):

Bash

dotnet run

Watch Mode (Auto-reload on save - Optional but helpful):

Bash

dotnet watch run

6. Deployment (Day 15)
Used to prepare the app for a real server.

Publish (Create optimized files):

Bash

dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish

Run the Published App:

Bash

cd publish
dotnet FlipkartClone.dll

7. Troubleshooting Commands
Commands we discussed to fix common errors.

Clear NuGet Cache (If package install fails):

Bash

dotnet nuget locals all --clear

Uninstall a Global Tool:

Bash

dotnet tool uninstall -g dotnet-aspnet-codegenerator

Check PostgreSQL Tables (Inside psql shell):

Bash

\dt
